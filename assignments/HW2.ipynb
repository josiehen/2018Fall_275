    "1. This homework can be finished by a single person or a group of **up to three people**. If this is a group, then it should involve people from **at least two different departments**. (You need to fill the box below)  Each team only needs to submit one copy of the homework (any team member can submit and the scores will be the same for all team members). So it is your responsibility to distribute the work relatively evenly within the team.\n",

One of the points of doing these exercises is to try to convince you that physical details and parameters only matter **to some extent** (they still matter!)"

The range of the bond length should include the equilibrium configuration (i.e. the configuration corresponding to the minimum of $E(R)$), but also extends to sufficiently large distance so that RHF fails (see below). \n",

Can you obtain qualitatively similar results when you apply RHF and UHF to this Hubbard dimer model? \n",
